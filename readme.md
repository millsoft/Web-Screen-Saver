#Web Screen Saver#
A simple screen saver for windows that will show any website.
For example you could display a news page, display some cool slideshows, animations, videos or display some fancy webgl animations.
The web screen saver uses the internet explorer engine. So anything that works in the internet explorer will also work in the web scree saver.
